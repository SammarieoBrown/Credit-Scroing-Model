# Credit Scoring Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on credit scoring, specifically building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of serious delinquency in 2 years. The dataset used for this project contains information about borrowers, their credit history, and other relevant variables.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into several main sections:

1. Package Management: This section includes the import statements for the necessary libraries used throughout the project.

2. Data Preprocessing: In this section, the data is loaded from an Excel file, and initial exploration and preprocessing steps are performed. This includes checking data types, handling missing values, and removing unwanted columns and duplicate values.

3. Data Exploration: This section involves exploring the dataset to gain insights and understand the distribution of variables. Descriptive statistics are calculated to summarize the data.

4. Data Visualization: In this section, data is visualized to provide a better understanding of the dataset. Univariate analysis is performed on the target variable, and its frequency distribution is plotted.

## Requirements
To run the code for this project, the following libraries are required:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

These libraries can be installed using the package manager pip:
